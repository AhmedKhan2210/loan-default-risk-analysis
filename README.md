# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating credit risk in lending by analyzing past loan data to better understand factors that lead to loan defaults. 
By carefully examining variables such as loan amount, loan type, interest rates, and borrower characteristics (e.g., age, credit score, region), 
the project categorizes loans into different risk levels. Feature engineering, such as the introduction of a “Risk Category,” provides a deeper insight into loan default trends, 
supporting more informed lending decisions without using machine learning models.


## Key Features

#Comprehensive Data Analysis:

Analyzes 150,000 loan records with 20 fields, focusing on factors like loan amount, interest rates, credit scores, and LTV ratios.
Data Preparation Techniques:

Addresses missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity for accurate analysis.

Feature Engineering:

Introduces the "Risk Category" variable to classify loans into risk levels based on LTV, credit score, and income.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Reveals key patterns in borrower demographics and loan preferences, highlighting relationships between loan characteristics and default rates.

Visualizations:

Uses heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar graphs to effectively communicate insights from the analysis.

Statistical Analysis:

Calculates effect sizes and conducts statistical tests to evaluate factors influencing default rates.

Actionable Recommendations:

Provides strategies for improved risk assessment, such as focusing on LTV ratios and implementing stricter credit assessments.
